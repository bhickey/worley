/* Worley()

   An implementation of the key cellular texturing basis
   function. This function is hardwired to return an average F_1 value
   of 1.0. It returns the <n> most closest feature point distances
   F_1, F_2, .. F_n the vector delta to those points, and a 32 bit
   seed for each of the feature points.  This function is not
   difficult to extend to compute alternative information such as
   higher order F values, to use the Manhattan distance metric, or
   other fun perversions.

   <at>    The input sample location. 
   <max_order>  Smaller values compute faster. < 5, read the book to extend it.
   <F>     The output values of F_1, F_2, ..F[n] in F[0], F[1], F[n-1]
   <delta> The output vector difference between the sample point and the n-th
            closest feature point. Thus, the feature point's location is the
            hit point minus this value. The DERIVATIVE of F is the unit
            normalized version of this vector.
   <ID>    The output 32 bit ID number which labels the feature point. This
            is useful for domain partitions, especially for coloring flagstone
            patterns.

   This implementation is tuned for speed in a way that any order > 5
   will likely have discontinuous artifacts in its computation of F5+.
   This can be fixed by increasing the internal points-per-cube
   density in the source code, at the expense of slower
   computation. The book lists the details of this tuning.  */
